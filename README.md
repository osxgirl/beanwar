# Getting Started with beanwar ‚òïÔ∏è üî´

This page will help you get started with beanwar. You'll be up and running in a jiffy!
Welcome to BeanWar!  
You're on your way to playing a React APP WAR card game! Here's some of the things you'll want to do to get going.


# üíé Starting up the APP
Welcome to my mintbean.io HACKATHON documentation!
This is a React APP with auth0 with a Ruby on Rails backend. The APP is a War car game played by clicking a button to deal cards. It is played as if you are the dealer. The cards are an original set of 52 & styled.

üïπ To Play ‚Äî Heroku APP : [https://beanwar.herokuapp.com](BeanWar)

‚å®Ô∏è To Clone ‚Äî Github Repo: [https://github.com/osxgirl/beanwar](Github)
Once cloned, yarn install and yarn start to have the APP compute. 

yarn start


# ‚ô•Ô∏è Database Documentation

The backend is a seeded database of comments that view under the game. Anyone can add a comment, there is no name or date associated with the comments and they can not be deleted. 
The local API is : http://localhost:3000/api/v1/comments.api
The web API is : https://peaceful-crag-53652.herokuapp.com/api/v1/comments.api

# üõ† Requirements of the Project
* You can build any game you'd like. Whether it's poker, blackjack, or just high-card wins, as long as it sticks to the following requirements:
* Your game must be played with cards from the standard 52-card deck.
* Your game must have a clear win condition. For example, in some games, getting rid of all your cards.
* Your game must have a clear lose condition. For example, in some games, scoring the lowest number of points.
* Accidental duplications of a card will be considered a bug, for which you will lose points. (See the scoring rubric for more details on how bugs affect your score)
* No collectible card games or non-standard decks allowed (so for example, no Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic the Gathering, or Pokemon. And no Tarot cards either.)
For backend applications
* There is no need to build a UI.
* Your API must support sign up and sign in. Auth0 is fine.
* There must be some meaningful reason for the backend to exist. For example, tracking the player's own scores or points (easy), or having a leaderboard (medium), or having multiplayer (hard).
* You must provide clear documentation and examples for your API.
For full-stack applications
* All of the requirements for Frontend and Backend applications apply.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
